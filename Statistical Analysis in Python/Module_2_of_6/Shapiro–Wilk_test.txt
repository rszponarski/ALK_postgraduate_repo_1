Shapiro-Wilk Test
The Shapiro-Wilk test is one of the most commonly used tests to check the normality of data.
* Its null hypothesis (H0) states that the data comes from a normal distribution.
If the p-value is greater than a certain significance level (e.g. 0.05), there is not enough evidence to reject
the null hypothesis, i.e. we can assume that the data comes from a normal distribution.

Hypothesis Testing Process

1. Hypothesis Formulation
H₀ (Null Hypothesis): Assumes no difference, no effect, no relationship between variables.
H₁ (Alternative Hypothesis): Assumes that differences, an effect, or a relationship exist.

2. Selecting the appropriate statistical test
Depending on the nature of the data (continuous, categorical) and the purpose of the study
(e.g., comparison of means, relationships), an appropriate test is selected.

3. Calculating the Test Value and P-Value
Test value: The result of a test (e.g., t, chi-square) that measures how strong the evidence is against
the null hypothesis.
p-value: The p-value measures the probability of obtaining results that are at least as extreme as the
observed results, assuming the null hypothesis is true.

4. Decision Making
If the p-value is less than a specified level of significance (e.g., 0.05), we reject the null hypothesis
and accept the alternative hypothesis.
If the p-value is greater than the significance level, we do not have enough evidence to reject the null
hypothesis, meaning that there is not enough evidence for an effect.

Summary

The null hypothesis (H₀) states that there is no difference or effect
If the p-value is less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis
and the alternative hypothesis (H₁) states that there is a difference or effect.

p-value < 0.05 THEN REJECT H0, ACCEPT H1

p-value > 0.05 THEN there is no evidence of non-normality SO the data are normally distributed

example: p-value = 0.0021 < 0.05, which indicates that the data are not normally distributed
(we reject the hypothesis of normality).
